## Game: Time Traveler
"Time Traveler" is an interactive decision-making game (similar to the video game Zork). You assume the role of a scientist who has invented a time machine and travels to various historical periods for the purpose of correcting past mistakes. Every decision you make can alter the course of historical events, affecting the civilizations you visit, from Ancient Egypt to the discovery of America.

The player must explore ancient civilizations, interact with historical figures, and make decisions that will influence the fate of these societies. The story changes dynamically based on the choices made, allowing for multiple endings and outcomes.

## Story
The protagonist is a brilliant scientist who has developed a time machine and decides to travel to crucial periods in human history to correct historical mistakes. The player must choose wisely which mistakes to correct, as every action has consequences. A wrong move can change history forever or even jeopardize your own existence.

## Objective
The objective of the game is to make changes that improve the conditions of the civilizations visited, or simply observe history as it occurred, with the option to return home or continue exploring new eras.

## Implementation
Python was used along with graph theory to facilitate navigation through the various historical periods. This approach allows for a structured representation of the events and decisions that the player can make. This use of graphs not only makes the journey through history clearer and more organized but also enables a dynamic gaming experience, where the player's decisions affect the development of the narrative and the state of the civilizations.

## Visitable Eras
- **Ancient Egypt (3100 B.C.):** Explore the pyramids under construction, visit bustling markets, or learn about Egyptian religion. Help improve working conditions, or let the past run its course.

- **America (1492):** Experience Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World. Decide whether to assist the native civilizations, such as the Aztecs, in facing the incoming conquerors.
